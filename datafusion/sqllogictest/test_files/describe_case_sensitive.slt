## DataFrame describe() Tests with Case-Sensitive Column Names
#############

# Test case for GitHub issue: describe() fails with case-sensitive column names
# This reproduces the issue where describe() would fail on JSON data with uppercase column names
# with error: "No field named assignedto. Did you mean '?table?.AssignedTo'?."

statement ok
CREATE TABLE test_case_sensitive AS VALUES
  ('alice@example.com', 5, 'high'),
  ('bob@example.com', 3, 'medium'), 
  ('charlie@example.com', 8, 'low')

# Create a view with case-sensitive column names to simulate JSON import behavior
statement ok
CREATE VIEW case_sensitive_data AS 
SELECT 
  column1 AS "AssignedTo",
  column2 AS "Bugs", 
  column3 AS "Priority"
FROM test_case_sensitive

# Verify the data is accessible with quoted column names
query TIT
SELECT "AssignedTo", "Bugs", "Priority" FROM case_sensitive_data ORDER BY "Bugs"
----
bob@example.com 3 medium
alice@example.com 5 high
charlie@example.com 8 low

# This is the core test - describe() should work with case-sensitive column names
# Previously this would fail with schema resolution error
statement ok
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM case_sensitive_data LIMIT 0)
