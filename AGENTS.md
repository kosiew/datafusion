# Repository Guidelines for Codex Agents

This repository uses Rust and contains documentation written in Markdown and TOML configuration files. When modifying code or docs, please follow these steps before committing:

1. **Run the Rust lints**
   ```bash
   ./dev/rust_lint.sh
   ```
   This script checks formatting (`cargo fmt`), lints (`cargo clippy`), validates `taplo` formatting and generates docs with warnings enabled.

2. **Format Markdown and TOML**
   ```bash
   # Format Markdown files
   prettier -w {datafusion,datafusion-cli,datafusion-examples,dev,docs}/**/*.md

   # Check TOML formatting
   taplo format --check
   ```

3. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
   You may also use `cargo nextest run` if installed.

4. **Optional: build documentation**
   ```bash
   ./docs/build.sh
   ```
   This renders the user and contributor guides.

Ensure these commands succeed before creating commits.

## PR Template

When creating a pull request, please use the following template:

```markdown
## Which issue does this PR close?

<!--
We generally require a GitHub issue to be filed for all bug fixes and enhancements and this helps us generate change logs for our releases. You can link an issue to this PR using the GitHub syntax. For example `Closes #123` indicates that this PR will close issue #123.
-->

- Closes #.

## Rationale for this change

<!--
 Why are you proposing this change? If this is already explained clearly in the issue then this section is not needed.
 Explaining clearly why changes are proposed helps reviewers understand your changes and offer better suggestions for fixes.  
-->

## What changes are included in this PR?

<!--
There is no need to duplicate the description in the issue here but it is sometimes worth providing a summary of the individual changes in this PR.
-->

## Are these changes tested?

<!--
We typically require tests for all PRs in order to:
1. Prevent the code from being accidentally broken by subsequent changes
2. Serve as another way to document the expected behavior of the code

If tests are not included in your PR, please explain why (for example, are they covered by existing tests)?
-->

## Are there any user-facing changes?

<!--
If there are user-facing changes then we may require documentation to be updated before approving the PR.
-->

<!--
If there are any breaking changes to public APIs, please add the `api change` label.
-->
```

## Rust Code Guidelines

When generating or modifying Rust code in this repository, follow these style and quality rules:

### Idiomatic Rust
- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions and modules.
- Use `CamelCase` for types, traits and enum variants.
- Prefer pattern matching and destructuring over indexing.
- Use iterators rather than explicit loops when applicable.
- Utilize strong typing and enums rather than raw values.
- Use `Option<T>` for optional values and `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations.
- Derive standard traits such as `Debug` and `Clone` where appropriate.

### Clippy Compliance
- Avoid unnecessary clones and allocations.
- Minimize `unwrap()` calls; prefer the `?` operator or proper error handling.
- Do not use `expect()` or `panic!()` except in tests; use proper error handling instead.
- Follow conventional lifetime names and avoid large stack allocations.
- Use explicit integer types and avoid wildcard imports.

### Error Handling
- Propagate errors with `Result` and the `?` operator.
- Use proper error handling with `Result` types
- Implement custom errors with the `thiserror` crate when needed.
- Add context when returning errors to aid debugging.

### Performance Considerations
- Prefer `&str` parameters over `String` when ownership isn't required.
- Use `Arc` for shared ownership and zero-copy techniques where possible.

### Code Organization
- Keep functions focused and under roughly 40â€“50 lines.
- Reuse existing utilities and extend them before adding new ones.
- Group related functionality into modules or `impl` blocks.

### Documentation and Comments
- Document public APIs with `///` comments and examples where helpful.
- Explain non-obvious logic with comments that describe "why" rather than "what".

Following these conventions helps maintain a consistent and high quality codebase.
